Responsive web design principles :

-- webpage adjust its layout and visual style to any possible screen size
-- There are 4 main ingredients to this : fluid layouts, responsive units, flexible images, 
media queries.
-- Desktop first [traditional way] (or) mobile first approach [modern way]
-- use max-width instead of width. If parent element width is less than the maximum width, then 
   element will take the width of the parent element.
-- rem (root element font size) : basically the font size of the 'html' element (which)
   is the root element of all elements. By default its equal to 16px.
   i.e. 1 rem = 16 px

   percentage (62.5%) : it is the percentage of the user's browser's font size. Which 
   by default 16px. But user can change it.
   So, if we want to change the default font size of the 'html' element then instead of using 
   'px' use '%'. Other wise whatever the user selects from the browser as their default
   font size, they will see a fixed font size. This can cause assessibility issues
   for some users.

   html {
       font-size : 62.5%;
   }

   .some-cls {
       max-width : 
   }
